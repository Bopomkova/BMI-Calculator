Please name variables well
ty

- let is used for variables that can be redefined, const is oviously used for constants
- You can use let and const without specifying a value if you just want to declare the variable as something that exists

    let variableHere;
    variableHere = valueHere;
    let variableHere = valueHere;

    const constant = valueHere; 

- Don't declare variables using var, just don't

- For values, put a text value in quotes, put something like a number or true/false without quotes

    variableHere = 7;
    variableHere = true;
    variableHere = "textHere";

- Use a value of null to indicate no value

- You can use math operations while defining variables

    variableHere = 7 + 7;
    variableHere = 7 + variableHere2;
